## Intro:
- Assumptions in structuring a program
- Assumptions in what is going to work better
- 

## Preparation
- Codebase implementation
- Stregnths of using the code structure that I did
- drawbacks of using said structure
- acknowledging biases in implementation

## Results
- What performed better in what situations
- Why I think it performed better
- Why it actually performed better (using some outside source)

## What I would do next time...
